  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
  In the 21st century, the media, the population are already aware of tricks in regular advertisements and thus try to silence them whenever they see them. Airline safety videos, however, are unavoidable, and this creates a perfect window of opportunity for airlines to subtly influence passengers. At first glance, Air Astana’s new safety video appears to be a standard regulatory instruction about safety as it shall be; however, a <strong>multimodal</strong> analysis reveals something hidden under the hood. The specifically chosen visual elements transform safety into care and hospitality by positioning the airline as a new Friend (or even family member). That is why, ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seatbelts as we are going to take off into the world of <strong>iconography, semiotics, and form</strong> (core concepts of visual analysis of any type of content) to understand <em>what</em> the elements are, <em>how</em> they affect your mindset.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The primary audience for this video is every passenger on Air Astana flights; the primary goal is to inform them what to do and how to behave during regular flight phases and emergencies. A secondary, persuasive goal is this: strengthening the emotional connection between the passengers and Air Astana. The secondary audience is the people interested in flying across Kazakhstan who found this video on YouTube. The unintended audience includes viewers who encounter the YouTube video without any motive to fly with Air Astana. The context of the video is that it is shown on every Air Astana flights, and specifically directed in the eve of Nauryz (Kazakh national holiday of New Year in March 22-23). The genre of the video is a safety video, and the sub-genre is a flight safety video. The video perfectly aligns with the genre as it has the elements of this very specific genre convention, and after watching the video, anyone will be fully instructed on actoins we have to take on any moment during the flight.

  <h2>Why Multimodal Analysis?</h2>
  <p>
   Following a multimodal analysis<a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>, it is clear that the video is a composition of <em>linguistic</em> (voiceover, labels), <em>visual</em> (images, color, pictograms), <em>spatial</em> (arrangements, formations), <em>gestural</em> (demonstrations, pointing), and <em>aural</em> (music, sound effects) modes. To interpret what elements embedded in a video mean, I will begin my analysis with the Iconography, followed by Semiotics and Form.

  <h2>Analysis Begins</h2>
  </section>
  <p>
  The film begins with a village celebration, and if we take a closer look, we can see people wearing national costumes, standing on altybakan (a national swing), preparing dishes and drinks. By incorporating our knowledge of Kazakh traditions (the second level of Iconographical analysis), we can deduce that the people are celebrating Nauryz. All those identified elements are connoted as a strong communal unity since Nauryz is celebrated among the closest relatives. This is how Air Astana wants you to treat them: to treat them as a close friend.
  </p>

       <blockquote class="pull-quote" aria-label="Pull quote">
    Connotation is about the socio-cultural meaning associated with the sign <sup><a href="#ref-4">[4]</a></sup>
  </blockquote>

      <img loading="lazy" alt="A flotilla of small yellow boats arrayed to suggest the silhouette of a life vest on calm water." src="vest and belt.jpeg" width="100%" height="450">
    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Boats form a vest and yurts form a belt.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>

By using the spatial modes, the village and ships align into the shapes of a <em>seatbelt and a life vest</em>. A philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce introduces a new term <strong>icons</strong>, that resembles the physical object, and in these examples, since they resemble a real seatbelt and life vest, they are <strong>icons</strong> <a href="#ref-4">[4]</a>. The connotative layer of a seatbelt is that <em>strong communal bonds</em> become your safety. As a seatbelt saves your life, close relatives save your life too. The vest can be taken as a <strong>metaphor</strong> (treating one thing as another <a href="#ref-5">[5]</a>). Air Astana suggests that communal bonds, work colleagues, and relatives are the real life vests. Just as the vest keeps the drowning person afloat, people who care about you will keep you afloat. The survival and community are tied together in this metaphor.

    <figcaption class="figcap">Symbols: 'Airplane mode', 'No smoking', and 'No electronic devices'</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>All 3 examples are instances of <strong>symbols</strong> in terms of semiotics. The symbols are globally recognized signs with meanings that anyone in the world can understand. The 'No Smoking' sing is the most widespread sign that can be found in lots of crowded locations. Despite being less popular, the other 2 signs of 'Airplane Mode ON' and 'No Electronic Devices' are still recognizable to people. Also, we can notice a tiny element, the Kazakh ornament, hidden in these 2 signs.

    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Business & Economy. The contrast between the classes</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>

    We can see the contrast between the demonstrations for the economy and business classes. While the flight attendant creatively (via village sign of belt and ships sign of vest) explains what to do, the business class male passengers shows everything on real equipment. This illustrates the idea that 'we are all in the same boat' (plane) and we are all treated and cared for equally by the crew of Air Astana.

    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Color and timing: yellow masks against neutrals, introduced with measured pacing.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>

  In this scene, the dropped masks act as an <strong>index</strong> (a sign that has a logical connected to its signified meaning) because the dropped masks mean the decompression of the cabin, which happens only during emergencies. On top of that, we shall analyze the color choice of clothes. All the colors are either white or in tones of blue (a color that is associated with safety). The authors want people to stay calm as the actors since the panic may lead to deaths.

    <figcaption class="figcap">Medieval Kazakh city</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>

    Just after the bright, calm sea scene, it abruptly switches to a dark medieval city scene. Roger Fry introduces a new flow of analysis called <strong>forms</strong> (how the visual text is presented <a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>), which is the perfect illustration of playing with <strong>Light and Shadow</strong>. The authors did it not only to illustrate how the cabine's inside brightness might be, but also to engage the audience as they have to pay attention on the next scene to find the nearest emergency exit locations.

    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Authority by adjacency: procedural rigor in aerospace settings.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>


   The medieval city plan is the signifier that acts as an <strong>icon</strong> to signify the plane map, with little green <strong>symbols</strong> of emergency exit signs that are common to any building worldwide. The authors deliberately made the scene of the emergency exit showcase bright with lots of candles so that passengers can see the emergency exit locations on a real plane. Another contrast appears as they move into the dark night scene of EXPO. The contrast is here not only with the brightness only, but also with the modernism. The plane map was made out of a medieval city, while the background EXPO is the futuristic building. This highlights the modernization of Kazakhstan and enhances its international brand.

<section id="iconological-conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The third level of Iconographic analysis is to group all the individual pieces of the video and trying to understand the entire video as a single item. Air Astana's new safety video highly emphasizes on care of passengers by a very creative method. The video demonstrates the Kazakh national identity and introduces foreign citizens to the Kazakh community. Air Astana upgrades Kazakhstan's image as a modern nation with vast landmarks and a unique culture, and at the same time, Air Astana positions itself as a friend who will guide and help them to enter Kazakhstan. The creative choice of semiotic signs all purposefully transforms Air Astana from a transportation company to a close relative.
