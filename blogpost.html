  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    In today’s media environment, audiences often tune out overt persuasion in posters, radio, and ads. Airline safety videos, however, are unavoidable—and thus uniquely potent. At first glance, Air Astana’s new safety video appears to be a standard regulatory instruction. A closer <em>multimodal</em> analysis reveals something more strategic: the film fuses Kazakh iconography (yurts, Nauryz, fishermen, landmarks) with standardized aviation semiotics (seatbelts, oxygen masks, life vests, prohibition symbols) and disciplined formal design (composition, lighting, rhythm, sound). Together these modes recast safety as care and hospitality—positioning the airline less as a rule-giver and more as a reassuring host. Fasten your seatbelts: what follows unpacks how iconography, semiotics, and form work in concert to transform mandatory instruction into cultural storytelling and soft power.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The primary audience for this video is every passenger on an Air Astana flight; the explicit goal is procedural clarity—how to fasten seatbelts, locate exits, and respond in emergencies. A secondary, persuasive goal emerges through the film’s cultural framing: strengthening brand trust and destination desire for international travelers and domestic flyers alike. The unintended audience includes viewers who encounter the piece beyond the cabin and read it as a short nation-branding film. My guiding claim is that the video deliberately aligns three domains: <strong>iconography</strong> (a national visual lexicon), <strong>semiotics</strong> (how these images function as signs), and <strong>form</strong> (the concrete design choices that focus attention and aid memory). By orchestrating linguistic, visual, spatial, gestural, and aural modes in tandem, the film produces a threefold persuasive effect—<em>ethos</em> (trust via heritage and rigor), <em>pathos</em> (belonging via family and community), and <em>logos</em> (stepwise clarity via redundancy).

  <h2>Why Multimodal Analysis?</h2>
  <p>
    Safety videos are a recognizable genre whose conventions include a sequential presentation of procedures with clear, redundant cues. Because meaning here is made through multiple channels at once, a multimodal approach is necessary. Following <a href="#ref-4">[4]</a>, I treat the video as a coordinated system of <em>linguistic</em> (voiceover, labels), <em>visual</em> (images, color, pictograms), <em>spatial</em> (arrangements, formations), <em>gestural</em> (demonstrations, pointing), and <em>aural</em> (music, sound effects) modes working together. To interpret what those images mean culturally, I draw on iconographic method (Panofsky’s descriptive → analytic → iconological levels) and semiotics (Peirce’s icon/index/symbol; Barthes’s denotation/connotation/myth). In practice: I first identify what we literally see; then how those elements resemble, point to, or conventionally signify safety actions; and finally, what deeper cultural idea the film advances when heritage is re-authored as protection.

    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Opening iconography: Nauryz celebration with yurts, traditional dress, communal games.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The film opens on a village celebrating Nauryz. Pre-iconographically, we see yurts, festive clothing, a manicured steppe, and convivial games. Iconographically, <em>yurts</em> function as emblems of nomadic heritage, hospitality, and home. The crucial move is how these cultural signs are translated into safety: through spatial composition, yurts and villagers align into the <em>shape of a seatbelt</em>. Semiotic function shifts here—this formation is primarily <strong>iconic</strong> (it resembles a belt) and secondarily <strong>symbolic</strong> (by convention, “fasten for safety”). It is not indexical of an actual emergency; rather, it visualizes the instruction being given. The connotative layer (Barthes) reframes the message: <em>home becomes protection</em>; safety is cast as a communal virtue rather than a purely technical act. <sup><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>
  </p>

    <figcaption class="figcap">Maritime tableau: local livelihoods re-authored as flotation instruction.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    A parallel transformation occurs on water: fishermen and small yellow boats assemble to read as a <em>life vest</em>—again, an <strong>iconic</strong> resemblance that carries a <strong>symbolic</strong> instruction (don, secure, float). The metaphor extends: the vest keeps you afloat in water; work and community keep you afloat in life—precisely the kind of secondary, mythic meaning Barthes describes. Meanwhile, a crowd forming a <em>no-smoking</em> sign is an iconic reproduction of a <strong>symbolic code</strong>: the cigarette silhouette is iconic; the red slash is symbolic by convention. In each case, local icons and global safety codes are braided so that heritage doesn’t decorate the message—it <em>delivers</em> it.

    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Affordance clarity: buckle close-up, aligned axes, amplified “click.”</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The design work that makes these signs legible is formal and precise. In the buckle demonstration, an extreme close-up isolates the mechanism; axes align so the latch and buckle read as a single unit; high-key lighting removes ambiguity; the <em>click</em> is slightly amplified; and the edit <em>holds</em> long enough for mimicry. This is multimodal redundancy in action: <strong>visual icon</strong> (what to do) + <strong>gesture</strong> (how to do it) + <strong>voiceover</strong> (why and when) + <strong>sound</strong> (confirmation).

    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Bodies as diagrams: the crowd becomes the pictogram.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    When passengers assemble into a <em>brace-position</em> glyph, the crowd becomes the pictogram. Semiotics here is layered: <strong>iconic</strong> (it looks like the safety card figure), <strong>indexical</strong> (it points to an action required <em>in this cabin</em> at this moment in the narrative), and <strong>symbolic</strong> (it encodes the social norm of collective responsibility). This spatial-gestural design rescues viewers from inference by inviting <em>mirroring</em>.
  </p>

      <img loading="lazy" alt="Oxygen masks hanging from open panels above seats; yellow masks pop against a neutral cabin palette." src="images/oxygen-masks.jpg" width="800" height="450">
    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Color and timing: yellow masks against neutrals, introduced with measured pacing.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The oxygen-mask sequence pairs a calm, authoritative voice with high-contrast color (yellow masks against neutral cabins). If the drop is staged as automatic, it can be read as a <strong>diegetic index</strong> of decompression (effect of cause inside the story world); otherwise the masks function iconically and symbolically as <em>stand-ins</em> for an emergency procedure. A close shot of a caregiver fitting a mask on a child adds pathos and models the “secure yours first” logic without confusion.

    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Wayfinding by analogy: torchlight stands in for emergency path lighting.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    A torchlit, historic interior introduces low-key lighting and emphatic pointing gestures. The torches do not iconically resemble aisle lights; they operate <strong>symbolically by analogy</strong> as wayfinding. Darkness cues seriousness; motivated light sources guide gaze to thresholds; deictic gestures create clear vectors for movement. The following montage accelerates over bridges and modern architecture (EXPO complex, city skylines), using symmetry and leading lines to connote order and cosmopolitan competence without pausing the instructional thread.

    </picture>
    <figcaption class="figcap">Authority by adjacency: procedural rigor in aerospace settings.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Scenes of a control room and astronauts in simulators lend <em>ethos by adjacency</em>: checklists, telemetry, and discipline are visually indexed to the airline’s safety culture. A rocket on the pad functions as an <strong>icon</strong> of ascent and a <strong>symbol</strong> of national ambition (not a literal index of the aircraft’s takeoff). The closing landscape and landmark shots consolidate the brand’s promise: safety procedures are universal, but the <em>story</em> that carries them belongs to Kazakhstan.

<section id="iconological-conclusion">
  <h2>Iconological Conclusion (Panofsky Level 3)</h2>
  <p>
    At the deepest level, the safety video composes a moral world in which <em>heritage becomes the very grammar of protection</em>. Traditional signs—yurts at Nauryz, fishermen on calm water, torchlit interiors—are not museum pieces but <em>active instruments</em>: the yurt is re-authored as a seatbelt, the flotilla as a life vest, the torch as wayfinding. Modern signs—bridges, the EXPO complex, control rooms, astronauts, a rocket poised to rise—do not cancel tradition; they <em>ratify</em> it, proposing that Kazakhstan’s futurity grows organically from communal care. By weaving these domains through disciplined form (affordance-focused close-ups, contrast for legibility, rhythmic montage, calm voiceover), the film advances an iconological thesis: to board this aircraft is to enter a <em>household</em> where safety is a shared virtue and compliance is an act of belonging. The crowd that assembles into glyphs turns strangers into a temporary polity; the no-smoking schema rehearses a universal code inside local imagery; the rocket’s ascent mythologizes progress without displacing procedure. Thus regulation is naturalized as hospitality, instruction as cultural participation, and the airline as a trustworthy host whose authority is both ancestral and technical. The persuasive outcome is not merely that passengers know <em>what</em> to do, but that they recognize <em>why</em> doing it feels right: because in this narrative, caring for oneself and others is how one flies—and how one belongs.
